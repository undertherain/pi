parallel Pi

==

This is an attempt to implement one simple algorithm (computing Pi number as definite integral)
using different parallel programming libraries/languages/language extensions etc.

We realize that different parallel frameworks serve different tasks, and thus can not be treated as mutually replaceable, nor can't we use this codes to make a performance comparisons  of any sort.  
More than that, we realize that in some cases the core ideas behind certain frameworks might be unrevealed.
We primarily target coders who are not majoring or specialising in parallel programing and aim to provide them with superficial glimpse of how coding in various parallel frameworks looks like. That is why we want to keep the problem in exactly same form for all the parallel frameworks we are working with to make a comprehensive comparison.
